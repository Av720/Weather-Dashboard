# Weather Dashboard

## Description

Weather Dashboard allows users to search a U.S. city and receive current weather along with a five-day forecast. The data is obtained from OpenWeather, a third-party API. Previously searched cities will populate in buttons beneath the search bar, providing the ability to reobtain up-do-date weather conditions for those cities.

Below is a link to the deployed application followed by a screenshot of the application.
